# GitHub Pull Request to Slack Workflow

This project automates the process of listening for GitHub pull request events and posting updates to a Slack channel. The workflow tracks the state of the pull request and meows at random people from a Google Sheet in the Slack channel.

## How It Works

1.	Receive GitHub pull request events (opened or reopened)
2.	Post updates to Slack with an initial message and dynamic updates as the pull requestâ€™s status changes
3.	Page team members by selecting a random person from a Google Sheet every 15 seconds and notifying them in Slack
4.	Conclude workflow when the pull request is closed or merged

## Cloud Usage (Recommended)

1. Initialize your connections through the UI
2. Set the `CHANNEL_ID`, `ORG_DOMAIN`, and `SHEET_ID` project variables in the "VARIABLES" tab

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Must be a Slack channel ID, not a Slack channel name.

3. Deploy the project

## Trigger Workflow

Once deployed, the workflow is triggered by a GitHub pull request event and continues to run, updating Slack until the pull request is closed or merged.

## Self-Hosted Deployment

Follow these [detailed instructions](https://docs.autokitteh.com/get_started/deployment) to deploy the project on a self-hosted server.
