# This YAML file defines a declarative manifest for an AutoKitteh project that
# creates Asana tasks from Google Calendar events.
#
# Before deploying this AutoKitteh project:
# - Set the "PROJECT_GID" in the vars section.
#   - **PROJECT_GID**: The GID of the Asana project to which tasks will be added.
#     You can find this GID in the URL of the project. It is the part after `/0/`.
#     For example, in `https://app.asana.com/0/your_project_gid/list`, `your_project_gid`  
# 
# After applying this file, initialize this AutoKitteh project's
# Google Calendar and Asana connections.
