# Gmail Support Email Workflow

[![Start with AutoKitteh](https://autokitteh.com/assets/autokitteh-badge.svg)](https://app.autokitteh.cloud/template?name=gmail_support_workflow)

This AutoKitteh project monitors Gmail for new emails from specific senders, analyzes them using ChatGPT to determine if they're support-related, and takes appropriate actions including sending auto-replies and Slack notifications.

## How It Works

1. Watches for new emails from a configured sender address
2. Uses ChatGPT to classify emails as support-related or not
3. Sends automated responses to support emails
4. Posts support email details to a designated Slack channel
5. Tracks processed emails to avoid duplicates

## Cloud Usage

1. Initialize your connections (Gmail, ChatGPT, Slack)
2. Configure the sender email and Slack channel in project vars
3. Deploy the project

## Trigger Workflow

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure all connections (Gmail, ChatGPT, Slack) are properly initialized; otherwise the workflow will raise a `ConnectionInitError`.

The workflow triggers on Gmail mailbox changes. To test:

1. Send an email from the configured sender address
2. The workflow will process it and respond accordingly

## Self-Hosted Deployment

Follow [these detailed instructions](https://docs.autokitteh.com/get_started/deployment) to deploy the project on a self-hosted server.

## Known Limitations

- Basic email body extraction (plain text only)
- ChatGPT classification may vary based on email content complexity
