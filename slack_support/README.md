# AI Driven Slack Support

[![Start with AutoKitteh](https://autokitteh.com/assets/autokitteh-badge.svg)](https://app.autokitteh.cloud/template?name=slack_support)

This project automates help request management by assigning experts based on AI-inferred topics and predefined expertise. It tracks requests, allows experts to claim and resolve them, and sends reminders if unclaimed.

For example, given this expertise table:

```
   | A       | B         | C
---+---------+-----------+--------------
 1 | Itay    | U12345678 | cats,dogs
 2 | Haim    | U87654321 | russian
```

This would happen:

## How It Works

1. Receive a help request from a user
2. Identify the request topic using Gemini AI
3. Assign the request to the appropriate expert based on the expertise table
4. Confirm the expertâ€™s acceptance of the request
5. Track the request until the expert resolves it
6. Remind the expert if the request remains unresolved within a set time

## Cloud Usage

1. Initialize your connections (Google Sheets, Google Gemini, Slack)
2. Set the `DIRECTORY_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` project variable, in the "VARIABLES" tab, to point to your Google Sheet
3. (Optional) Set the `HELP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` project variable, in the "VARIABLES" tab, to set the timeout for unclaimed requests
4. Deploy project

## Trigger Workflow

The workflow is triggered when the bot is mentioned in a message within a channel where it is a member. For example:

```
@autokitteh help me with my cat
```

When a topic matches an expert's expertise, the bot notifies them. The expert can use:

- `!take` to claim the request
- `!resolve` to mark it complete

## Self-Hosted Deployment
