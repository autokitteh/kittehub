# CarbCat üê±

[![Start with AutoKitteh](https://autokitteh.com/assets/autokitteh-badge.svg)](https://app.autokitteh.cloud/template?name=gocat)

An AI-powered WhatsApp chatbot that helps users track carbohydrate content in their food. Simply message the bot with what you're eating, and it will tell you how many carbs are in your meal using the comprehensive USDA food database.

Do not rely solely on CarbCat for medical decisions, dietary management, or health-related calculations. Always consult with healthcare professionals, registered dietitians, or certified diabetes educators for personalized nutritional advice and medical guidance.

## Features

- **WhatsApp Interface**: Natural conversation through WhatsApp via Twilio
- **AI-Powered**: Uses Claude with tool use capabilities to understand food descriptions
- **Comprehensive Database**: Built on USDA FoodData Central SR Legacy dataset with thousands of foods
- **Smart Matching**: Fuzzy search algorithm to find foods even with approximate names
- **Portion Awareness**: Calculates carbs based on specific portions and amounts
- **Multi-Turn Conversations**: Clarifies ambiguous foods through follow-up questions

## How It Works

1. Send a message to the WhatsApp bot describing what you're eating
   - Example: "2 slices of whole wheat bread"
2. The AI analyzes your message and searches the food database
3. If needed, it asks clarifying questions about portion sizes or specific foods
4. Receive the total carbohydrate content instantly
